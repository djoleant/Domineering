### What is Domineering
Domineering (also called Stop-Gate or Crosscram) is a mathematical game that can be played on any collection of squares on a sheet of graph paper. For example, it can be played on a 6×6 square, a rectangle, an entirely irregular polyomino, or a combination of any number of such components. Two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn, covering up squares. One player places tiles vertically, while the other places them horizontally. (Traditionally, these players are called "Left" and "Right", respectively, or "V" and "H". Both conventions are used in this article.) As in most games in combinatorial game theory, the first player who cannot move loses. [1]

### Problem description
-> Problem is the game "Domineering" </br>
-> Board dimensions: mxn </br>
-> Tiles dimensions: 2x1 </br>
-> Two players: X and O </br>
-> Player that can't place tile on the board loses </br>
-> Human vs Computer (it is optional who plays first) [2]

### Game rules
-> Board is initially empty </br>
-> Players play alternately </br>
-> First player can place tiles only vertically and another one horizontally </br>
-> Tiles can't overlap or peek out of the board [2]
